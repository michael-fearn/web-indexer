# web-indexer

I'm not completely sure what this is going to end up being. I do know it's a love letter to the first real software project I built, Affinity.

Indexing a web page creates entries for all word occurrences and gives context to what surrounds each word. Words and their context have references to the pages they were indexed from. All of the hrefs a page contains are recorded as well. Pages reference each other as well.

The api exposes the ability to search these indexes.
